# Crypto-Fiat Converter Service

This service allows users to **register cryptocurrencies**, and **convert between fiat and crypto currencies** using real-time exchange rates. It integrates with external APIs for accurate pricing and runs a **background worker** to update exchange rates regularly.

## Features

### üîÅ Currency Conversion
- **Fiat to Crypto:** Convert any amount in fiat currency (e.g., USD, EUR, GHS) to its equivalent in a registered cryptocurrency (e.g., BTC, ETH).
- **Crypto to Fiat:** Convert cryptocurrency amounts to their fiat currency equivalent.

### üí∞ Coin Registration
- Easily register new coins you want to support in your application.
- Each registered coin is tracked and updated with the latest exchange rate.

### üîÑ Background Rate Updater
A background worker runs at scheduled intervals to fetch and update exchange rates from two main sources:
- [CoinGecko](https://api.coingecko.com/api/v3/coins/markets?vs_currency=usd) ‚Äì for **cryptocurrency rates**.
- [OpenExchangeRates](https://openexchangerates.org/) ‚Äì for **fiat currency rates**.

Rates are stored in the cache for fast access during conversions.
